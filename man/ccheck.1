.SH NAME
CCHECK \fB\-\-\fR Contamination Check for mia
.SH SYNPOSIS
ccheck [\-r \fIref.fa\fR] [\-a] [\-t] [\-s \fIM\-N\fR] [\-v] \fIaln.maln\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
CCHECK looks at alignments in .maln assembly files as generated by
\fBMIA\fR and tries to determine for each sequence whether it is likely
to be a known contaminant or genuine sequence.  Here \fIref.fa\fR is the
expected contaminant in FastA format, \fIaln.maln\fR is the output from
\fBMIA\fR, typically the last iteration.  \fBccheck\fR aligns the
assembled sequence and the contaminant, determining positions that are
diagnostic for contamination.  It then aligns each sequence from
the maln file to the contaminant in the same way \fBMIA\fR would have
and checks for clearly aligned diagnostic positions.  Depending on
whether these positions are consistent with genuine sequence and/or
contamination, sequences are labelled clean, contaminant, conflicting,
nonsensical or uninformative.  A contamination estimate with confidence
intervals is then printed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB--reference\fR \fIref.fa\fR
Defines the expected contaminant.  If your assembly is the mitochondrion
of a primate, \fIref.fa\fR would be the consensus of many human
mitochondria.  The reference is allowed to contain the \fIN\fR code for
unknown positions.
.TP 
\fB\-a\fR, \fB--ancient\fR
Treat DNA as ancient, that is, assume it suffered deamination.  This
option has no influence on the alignment algorithm (it always takes its
substitution matrices from the maln file), it merely tells \fBccheck\fR
that a \fIT\fR or an \fIA\fR in a sequence are uninformative because
they could have been formed from a \fIC\fR or \fIG\fR, respectively.  In
contrast, \fIC\fR and \fIG\fR remain informative in any case.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB--transversions\fR
Restrict analysis to sites that show a transversion between reference
and assembly.  Using this option throws away valuable information and is
only recommended if you're going to write a paper and don't want to
explain why you trust a \fIC\fR but don't trust a \fIT\fR.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB--span\fR \fIM\-N\fR
Restrict analysis to the range from \fIM\fR to \fIN\fR on the reference
(contaminant sequence).  Sticking with the mitochondrion example, you
could restrict the analysis to the hypervariable region.  Again, this
throws away information and is only useful to pacify reviewers of your
paper.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB--maxd\fR \fID\fR
Allow up to \fID\fR differences when aligning assembly and reference.
This option is not normally needed, unless your contaminant differs
significantly from the reference.  Then you could specify a bigger
\fID\fR, though \fBccheck\fR will likely be useless anyway.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Increases the amount of debug output.  If repeated, produces even more
output.

.SH NOTES
Despite this documentation, which hints otherwise, you should probably
not base a scientific paper on the output from this program.  Use at
your own risk.

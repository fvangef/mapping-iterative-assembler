.SH NAME
MA \fB\-\-\fR Mapping Assembler
.SH DESCRIPTION
MA reports information for a .maln assembly file as generated by \fBMIA\fR. It can also convert the .maln files into different alignment formats. 
.SH SYNPOSIS
ma [\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fB\-M\fR \fI<maln input file>\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fI<consensus code>\fR
How the assembly calls each base can be determined by the consensus code.
.RS
.TP 
\fB1\fR = 
highest, positive aggregate score base (if any)
.TP
\fB2\fR =
highest aggregate score base if it is 2400 higher than second highest
.RE
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fI<output format>\fR
Select the \fIoutput format\fR as one of the following. See \fIFORMATS\fR for a full description of available formats.
.RS
.PD 0
.TP 
\fB1\fR => 
clustalw
.TP
\fB2\fR => 
line format
.TP
\fB3\fR => 
column format 
.TP
\fB4\fR =>
13-column format 
.IP
of all assembly data for positions that \fIdiffer\fR between consensus and \fBCURRENT\fR reference sequence of this iteration. 
.TP
\fB41\fR => 
13-column format, but for \fIALL\fR positions
.TP
\fB5\fR =>
fasta
.TP
\fB6\fR =>
region format
.IP
shows the reference sequence, the consensus sequence, and then all assembled fragments in a region specified by option \fB\-R\fR
.RS
.TP
\fB\-C\fR
Also color the format \fB6\fR output \-> don't pipe this output to file!
.RE
.TP
\fB61\fR => 
multi-fasta
.IP
same as above, but in multi\-fasta format for viewing in Bioedit, e.g. (also requires a region as specified by the option \fB\-R\fR)
.TP
\fB7\fR => ACE
.RE
.PD
.TP
\fB\-R\fR <\fIREGION_START\fR:\fIREGION_END\fR>
Output only for a certain region. Use together with a \fIregion format\fR (\fB-f 6\fR or \fB-f 61\fR)
.TP
\fB\-I\fR <\fIID\fR> 
\fIConsensus_ID\fR to assign to assembly sequence

.SH FORMATS
The following output formats can be chosen by using \fB-f\fR option. 
.RS
.TP 
\fB1\fR => 
clustalw
.TP
\fB2\fR => 
line format
.PD 0
.IP
\fBfirst line\fR is "Consensus, \fIreference_name\fR, coverage:"
.IP
\fBsecond line\fR is the entire, assembled, aligned consensus sequence
.IP
\fBthird line\fR is the entire aligned reference sequence to which the consensus is aligned
.IP
\fBfourth line\fR is the sequence coverage at each position in a spaceseparated list of integers
.PD
.TP
\fB3\fR => 
column format 
.IP 
one line per base, one column for consensus, reference, and coverage; includes header with summary info
.TP
\fB4\fR =>
13-column format of all assembly data for positions that differ between consensus and \fBCURRENT\fR reference sequence of this iteration. 

.B
Note that in the FINAL iteration reference and consensus are equal! So there won't be any output. 
.IP
Each row has the following columns: 
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
\fB(1)\fR
position on reference; 0\-based coordinates 
.TP
\fB(2)\fR
reference base
.TP
\fB(3)\fR
consensus assembly base
.TP
\fB(4)\fR
coverage
.TP
\fB(5)\fR
A's
.TP
\fB(6)\fR
C's
.TP
\fB(7)\fR
G's
.TP
\fB(8)\fR
T's
.TP
\fB(9)\FR
gaps; 
.IP
columns \fB5\fR through \fB9\fR should add up to column \fB4\fR 
.TP
\fB(10)\fR
aggregate score for \fIA\fR
.TP
\fB(11)\fR
aggregate score for \fIC\fR
.TP
\fB(12)\fR
aggregate score for \fIG\fR
.TP
\fB(13)\fR
aggregate score for \fIT\fR
